**Objective:** 
To establish a set of normalized values for colors. By creating and using a set of normalized color values, we will ensure consistency and accuracy in color representation across different products.  This standardized approach facilitates better communication and understanding of colors.

**Steps:**
Under tab, Normalized List of Colors, you will find colors (normalized values) and aliases (other colors that represent the normailized value). 
For each tab (Color, RetailerColors & RetailerGarmentColors), fill in the 'mapped value(s)' column with the normalized color(s) that correspond to the 'colors' column.
There can be more the one value in the "mapped value(s)" column separated by a comma.

**Notes:**
skin always is brown
If mulitcolor or rainbow, list all colors found on the product.
If camoflauge, list the main color of the camoflauge.
